# Collective Behavior Project: Feeding a School of Fish

MÃ©linda Fabien, Sarah Gay, Ana Gelez, Alina Sereda

Problem: how does different feeding techniques impacts the population of a school of fish in a tank, and which one is the best for aquaculture?

## Planned steps

- read the paper we chose, and review related litterature
- reproduce our starting point in Godot
- write the first report (deadline: 20/11)
- add some conditions for the death of a fish
- add some conditions under which fishes can reproduce (optional, if we have enough time)
- write the second report (deadline: 18/12)
- add a way to see the evolution of the number of fish in the tank (and maybe other metrics like their total mass)
- produce results in differents scenarii and discuss them
- write the final report (deadline: 08/01)
