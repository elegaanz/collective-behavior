## Introduction 

In this project, our goal is to replicate the behavior of a group of fish in a controlled tank environment. To achieve this, we will draw inspiration from the research presented in the article accessible [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280017) We'll use the insights from the article to create a computer model that simulates fish behavior in an aquaculture environment. We'll rely on the Godot game engine to build a 3D virtual setting for this purpose.

The central objective of our project is to address a fundamental question:  **how do various feeding techniques influence the population of a school of fish in a tank, and which technique is most suitable for aquaculture purposes?** To answer this question, we have outlined a series of planned steps.

## Planned steps

- Read the paper we choose, and review related literature to build a strong foundation on the subject
- Reproduce the model found in the article in Godot based 
- Prepare and submit the initial project report by the deadline of 20/11.
- Implement conditions for fish mortality within the simulation.
- Add conditions under which fishes can reproduce (optional, if we have enough time)
- Prepare and submit the second project report by the deadline of 18/12
- Integrate a mechanism to monitor the evolution of fish population within the tank, including metrics like their total mass (and maybe other metrics like their total mass)
- Generate and analyze results from different scenarios to facilitate a comprehensive discussion.
- Conclude the project and compile the final project report by the deadline of 08/01.
